These are my transcribed notes for the Caltech courses I sat in on.

Since Math 120A was markedly different as a course from Math 120B and
Math 120C, I have split these courses up into their own folders.

- Fall 2025 quarter
  - Math 120A taught by Josef Svoboda (MWF, 9:00-9:55am)
  - Math 151A taught by Yi Ni (MWF, 10:00-10:55am)
  - Math 108A taught by Lily Reeves (MWF, 11:00-11:55am)
  - Math 130A taught by Weihong Xu (MWF, 1:00-1:55pm)
